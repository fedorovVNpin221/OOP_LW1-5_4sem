<p><strong>Seven Ages Of Man:</strong></p>
<p>All the world's a stage</p>
<p>And all the men and women merely players,</p>
<p>They have their exits and entrances,</p>
<p>And one man in his time plays many parts,</p>
<p>His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,</p>
<p>Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.</p>
<p>Then, the whining schoolboy with his satchel</p>
<p>And shining morning face, creeping like snail</p>
<p>Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,</p>
<p>Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad</p>
<p>Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,</p>
<p>Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,</p>
<p>Jealous in honour, sudden, and quick in quarrel,</p>
<p>Seeking the bubble reputation</p>
<p>Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice</p>
<p>In fair round belly, with good capon lin'd,</p>
<p>With eyes severe, and beard of formal cut,</p>
<p>Full of wise saws, and modern instances,</p>
<p>And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts</p>
<p>Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,</p>
<p>With spectacles on nose, and pouch on side,</p>
<p>His youthful hose well sav'd, a world too wide,</p>
<p>For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,</p>
<p>Turning again towards childish treble, pipes</p>
<p>And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,</p>
<p>That ends this strange eventful history,</p>
<p>Is second childishness and mere oblivion,</p>
<p>Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.</p>
